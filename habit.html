<p>The word habit in this instance means “clothing” and not “something that a person does often in a regular and repeated way.” This is, in fact, the oldest meaning of habit in English, one that is preserved today only in “nun's habit” or “monk's habit” and “riding habit” (clothes worn for horseback riding)Habits - from clothing to culture

Keeping a lot of papers in the shirt pockets, slanted pen fastened in shirt placket, pouch hung across the chest, trouser bottom folded, sleeves rolled up showing biceps, shirts half inserted in trouser waist, trousers clinging down the waist, t-shirts worn inside shirts (no matter whatever the season is), top two-three buttons opened in shirt/ kurtas, handkerchiefs folded diagonally becoming hair bands etc. and many more (psychologically each of them may have some or the other connotation or relevance).... many may wonder, from where these habits have originated?



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Interestingly, these customization have evolved out of human needs and zest to personify their belongings, their interaction and understanding in terms of utility and relevance (Various manuals do talk about the utility of various functions imbibed within the gadget, and also precaution note etc. but does any manual talk about where to keep, at what angle shall it be kept during usage, and how much pleasure would it hold and so on). Interface between the user, object and environment generates set of rituals, which we perceive as habits (During 17th and 18th century a lot of mannerism use to deal with issues of good or bad habits, primarily originated of cultural and religious milieu, a differentiating factor amongst the cultured and non-cultured).

These customs and rituals (neo-habits) have originated with the changing sense of belongings, lifestyle pattern, means and modes of communication, interactivity to the real and virtual world and many such issues. Do our clothes really serve what are required in new-age lifestyle, and the "intermediate"***** patterns of living?

*****Somesh Singh, and Himanshu Vaidya had mentioned elaborate lifestyle pattern in "Intermediates future of fashion", a research project in Indian menswear.

Self Image- in search of Individualism

One may wonder why "habit factor" is emphasized, though other attributes are equally important which constitute fashion and trend. Habits are predominant cause, that effect' utility and usability pattern, be it physical, behavioral or perceptual. For example:

Plastic Money, I-pods, Hand held devices (PDAs), Cell phones and many such new nuances have become the integral part of daily life, which requires extensive care and protection. Their regular use has created newer Patterns of habit and interactivity towards clothing. Do we remember any single garment that accommodates these gadgets comfortably? Many may agree or disagree to this fact, and many Brands and Companies may claim that they have already provided POCKETS or AREAS, which takes care of such issues (Scientifically incorrect).

One of the recent surveys (personal contact method used amongst more than 100 students and faculty at NID and local people at Ahmedabad) revealed that 90% of people have quoted "difficult" to accommodate these gadgets in the existing garments and it may be due to the lack of ergonomically correct details.
